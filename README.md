I contribute to a lot of different projects and frequently author
documentation in the process. This is a place to collect the various
pieces of documentation. Some of it may have already been pulled into
upstream.

The basic structure is the top level directory contains directories
for each project or major topic. Under that will specific pieces of
documentation for that project. Currently the structure is:

* mod_auth_mellon
