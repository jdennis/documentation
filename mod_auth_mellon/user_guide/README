This is the mod_auth_mellon User Guide. It is written in AsciiDoc
which is a popular plaintext markup language much like markdown or
reStructuredText. You can find extensive documentation on AsciiDoc and
AsciiDoctor on the web. AsciiDoc can be rendered into a variety of
formats, but one of it's great advantages is the ability to produece
DocBook.

There are many ways to render AsciiDoc, but the simplest to produce
html is this:

% asciidoctor mellon_user_guide.adoc

If you want to edit the source it can be very useful to be able to see
the rendered version as you work. This link is a guide on how to do
that. Included in this directory is a Guardfile which can be used in
conjuction with the live preview discussed in the link.
